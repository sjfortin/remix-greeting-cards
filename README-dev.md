## Auth flow

Here's that written out:

- On the `/login` route.
- User submits login form.
- Form data is validated.
  - If the form data is invalid, return the form with the errors.
- Login type is "register"
  - Check whether the username is available
    - If the username is not available, return the form with an error.
  - Hash the password
  - Create a new user
- Login type is "login"
  - Check whether the user exists
    - If the user doesn't exist, return the form with an error.
  - Check whether the password hash matches
    - If the password hash doesn't match, return the form with an error.
- Create a new session
- Redirect to the `/jokes` route with the `Set-Cookie` header.
